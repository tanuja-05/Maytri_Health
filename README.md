Excited to share an overview of my new project! 'MATRI HEALTH'

`MATRI HEALTH` is a web application designed to provide predictive healthcare solutions focusing on maternal risk, fetal health and RPOS risk prediction. The application leverages machine learning models to assess pregnancy risks and fetal health conditions, offering insights to both healthcare professionals and users. It includes an interactive dashboard and a chatbot for user assistance. It also features a model that calculates the calorie content of food based on an image input.

Core Functionalities:

- Pregnancy Risk Prediction
- Fetal Health Prediction
- PCOS Risk Prediction
- Visual Analytics Dashboard
- Food Calorie Detection
- Chatbot Assistance
- Impact and Future Enhancements:

`MATRI HEALTH` aims to enhance maternal and fetal healthcare accessibility by leveraging AI for early detection, preventive care, and personalized health insights. Future improvements may include real-time monitoring, integration with wearable health devices, and expanded diagnostic capabilities for broader maternal health concerns. This project stands as a testament to the power of AI in improving healthcare outcomes, reducing maternal and fetal risks, and empowering women with essential health knowledge.

This project was developed by me as part of the 24-hour hackathon ‘UDGHAM’ conducted at `Woxsen University`, where the focus was on leveraging AI and data science for impactful healthcare solutions.
